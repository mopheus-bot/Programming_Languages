# Grocery Tracking

This program's goal was to properly implement Python into a C++ program. It read a list of products that were sold in a day from an inpuit file, analyzed that data, and gave the user a menu in which they could select different ways of viewing the data. It also wrote to an output file. I think that I used functions in both C++ and Python effectively and efficiently. I could have enhanced my code in a way that gave me more freedom with what I could pass between Python and C++. This would allow me to perhaps pass an entire list or dictionary between the two languages, as opposed to writing to an output file or asking Python to analyze the data multiple times. I found that trying to accomplish this was the most challenging portion of this program. I overcame this by using different resources and researching the topic. StackOverflow and w3schools were very helpful. However, I now understand how to implement Python into a C++ program, the benefits and limitations, and how to avoid memory leaks. I ensured the maintainability, readability, and adaptibility of this program by using best practice standards, functions, and comments.
